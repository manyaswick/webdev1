Take a look at the supplied web comp and write the HTML and CSS to reproduce it. You’ll have to select and save the images from the comp just as you did the previous homework assignment.

There are assets included in the singolo folder for you to use. You will create your own CSS file and copy/import these files of `border-box.css`, `clearfix.css` and `font-face.css` into it for your use. In your `index.html` file, you will need to link to both the `normalize.css` file and your CSS file.

All files (HTML, CSS, Images, **[NOT YOUR PSD's]**) are to be submitted to GitHub and uploaded to a folder on the Circuslabs server named “Singolo”. You will need to validate your HTML & CSS as well as test & submit the CircusLabs URL in your GitHub commit.

This is all due Monday @ 2:00am before our Week 7 class.
