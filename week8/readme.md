Take a look at the supplied web comp and write the HTML and CSS to reproduce it. You’ll have to select and save the images from the comp just as you did the previous homework assignment.

Like the previous websites, there are assets for you to import and bring into your site. Please do so and make sure you link everything up.

All files (HTML, CSS, Images, **[NOT YOUR PSD's]**) are to be submitted to GitHub and uploaded to a folder on the Circuslabs server named “Spice”. You will need to validate your HTML & CSS as well as test & submit the CircusLabs URL in your GitHub commit.

This is all due Monday @ 2:00am before our Week 9 class.
